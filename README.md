# Publicis-Pulse-Survey

Description - This project is about creating a Power BI dashboard that shows feedback received from clients through a survey called Publicis Pulse Survey. The survey is sent twice a year to understand how happy clients are with Publicis agencies.

•Enabled leadership to quickly view overall client satisfaction for the current wave through NPS and Star Ratings with clear color-coded indicators.
•Helped business users compare satisfaction wave-over-wave, allowing them to track whether service quality improved or declined between April and September.
•Allowed regional and country leaders to identify underperforming geographies and take targeted corrective actions.
•Highlighted which agencies were performing well and which required immediate attention, supporting decision-making during performance reviews.
•Provided visibility into survey participation levels by showing completed vs sent counts, helping teams follow up with low-response markets.
•Revealed patterns in scoring behavior using distribution charts, helping analysts understand whether dissatisfaction was widespread or driven by a few respondents.
•Showed how satisfaction varies by client tenure, seniority, and decision-maker level, helping business teams focus on influential or long-term client relationships.
•Supported comparison of service quality across People, Delivery, Services, and Strategy to identify which service areas consistently scored low.
•Provided a consistent, drill-down view from region → sub-region → country → agency → client, improving transparency across the global network.
